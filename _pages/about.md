Welcome!

I am a junior Professor at the [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/en) in Grenoble, affiliated with the NLP team [GetAlp](https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at EPFL, under the guidance of Robert West in the [Data Science Lab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/). In 2019, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [UKP lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt, advised by Iryna Gurevych.

In my research, I am interested in understanding and overcoming challenges arising from the prevailing statistical perspective in NLP systems development. Going beyond statistical boundaries requires adopting a [causal perspective](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/). Equipped with the tools of causality, we can effectively tackle issues like out-of-distribution generalization, biases in pre-trained models, and extract mechanistic interpretations of the complex behavior of these models.
